### **Adverse Effects of High Cholesterol**

Nearly 40% of adults in the United States grapple with high cholesterol levels, defined as total blood cholesterol equal to or exceeding 200 mg/dL. This elevated cholesterol poses a significant risk for heart disease and stroke, both prominent contributors to mortality in the United States. (CDC, 2023)

### **National Prevalence**

Upon data analysis, we condensed the cholesterol risk across different locations in the United States from the **PLACES: Local Data for Better Health** dataset ([sources, part 1](source.html)), identifying key behavioral factors predominantly associated with the risk through correlation analysis.

Read [Prevalence EDA](eda.html) here.

### **Cholesterol-Associated Factors**

After utilizing **NHANCES** dataset ([sources, part 2](source.html)), we made a in-depth [Exploratory Analysis](Exploratory-Analysis.html), and at last we pinpointed the primary influencers of cholesterol and constructed the final [Build Model](model.html) for predicting individual cholesterol levels.
